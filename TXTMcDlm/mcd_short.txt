McDonald's has an obesity problem that continues to get worse. And that's nothing to do with the food itself, but rather the huge menus that can now double as medieval fortification. For perspective, the chain's menu has grown 70% since 2007. And while more offerings might seem like a good thing, large menus result in slower service and more flare-ups between franchisees and the corporation.

Bloated menus raise inventory costs for smaller franchisees and lead to lower profit margins. The McDonald's corporate franchise fee is based upon sales instead of profits, making it a smaller concern for the company overall.
